# Documentation Progress - October 15, 2025

## âœ… Completed: POST /api/products

The main product creation endpoint now has comprehensive documentation matching your FD Calculator example:

### What's Included:
- **18-line detailed description** with use cases
- **4 complete request examples** (Savings, FD, Loan, Current Account)
- **2 success response examples** with full JSON
- **3 error response examples** (validation, enum, duplicate)

---

## ðŸ“Š Remaining Work: 40 Endpoints

### ProductController: 5 remaining
- GET /api/products (list with pagination)
- GET /api/products/{code} (get single)
- PUT /api/products/{code} (update)
- DELETE /api/products/{code} (delete)
- GET /api/products/search (search)

### 7 Sub-Resource Controllers: 35 endpoints total
- Interest, Balance, Charge, Rule, Transaction, Role, Communication
- Each has 5 endpoints (POST, GET all, GET one, PUT, DELETE)

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Decision Needed

**Which would you like me to tackle next?**

1. Complete ProductController (5 endpoints)
2. Document InterestController (5 endpoints)  
3. Document BalanceController (5 endpoints)
4. Or specify another priority

I've established the documentation pattern with POST /api/products. Now I need your direction on which controller or endpoints to prioritize next!
